When onboarding users into a system, cryptoeconomic or otherwise, be careful to balance between challenge and skill.  Too far to one side, and the user gets bored.  Too far to another, and they get frustrated.

Many people in countries such as Venezuela, [Argentina](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/four-countries-looking-to-counter-inflation-with-bitcoin) and Zimbabwe have turned to Bitcoin to protect their monetary assets from the devastating inflation that has reduced their purchasing power and ability to survive their countries’ economic crises.&#x20;

Bitcoin has also been used to oppose tyrannical regimes: In Russia, for example, the top political opponent of the Putin regime, [Alexy Navalny](https://www.fairplanet.org/editors-pick/alexei-navalnys-arrest-was-a-flagrant-assault-on-human-rights/), [collected donations in Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/24/russian-opposition-leader-raises-3-million-in-bitcoin-donations/) to fuel his campaign, circumventing the government-owned financial system. In Belarus, a non-profit called BYSOL has received over [$2 million worth of donations in Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/08/bitcoin-dissidents-those-who-need-it-most/) to help activists defy the contested election of Lukashenko’s regime.
