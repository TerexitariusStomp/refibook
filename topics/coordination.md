# Coordination

&#x20;How Does humanity coordinate?

All coordination is a choice. What we choose to do when presented that choice is up to us.

When incentive systems are aligned, more economic agents will take the aligned actions than before.

What if we could align the incentive systems between public, private, and common goods to create more human thriving?

Moving beyond 1:1 coin voting is an opportunity to create more cartel-resistant forms of governance. There are inequalities and incentive misalignments even in the absence of attackers (these systems can be dominated by the rich & powerful), and (outright attacks through various forms of (often obfuscated) vote buying in 1:1 coin voting systems.

Decentralized Reputation Systems - Because so much value transfer in the world depends on the reputation of the parties in the transaction, it could be argued that Identity is an important part of the internet of value.

Proof of Personhood - If we could find a cryptoeconomic way to prove unique human-ness, we could move the internet of finance from “one token one vote” to “one human one vote” and unleash a wave of digital democracy. With proof of personhood, the ecosystem could move to DAOs built on one-human-one-vote. This unlocks use cases like:

Gini coefficient measurements

The new world privacy model will be built around zero knowledge proofs, eg you will be able to prove attributes about yourself without revealing any more personal information about yourselves.

mpactDAOs can stack

Each ImpactDAO benefits from all the stacked ImpactDAOs supporting their work.

Scalability: ImpactDAO stacking is how growth compounds, momentum builds, and regenerative cryptoeconomics eventually becomes inevitable.

Each DAO had its own mission, goals, and focus and tightly curated culture.&#x20;

&#x20;\- pluralism: skin to biodiversity.  The more pluralism there is  across an ecosystem, this creates more antifragility as it grows.

\- expressivity: eg the collection of primitives available should be reach enough to allow actors to express organizations we've not thought of yet.

\- simplicity/legibility: individual primitives should be relatively simple, you can combine them into more complex assemblages.&#x20;

\- standardization: a sufficiently large library of legible primitives that you can almost always find a known simple/legible component that meets your needs, will accelerate innovation.

\- modularity/composibility: this comes pretty naturally from simplicity and standardization, and assuming you collection of primitives is sufficiently expressive you can create assemblages that do just about anything.

\- symmetry between value creation & value capture - when the value creation&#x20;

of a system is disconnected from the value capture, there will be an inherent misalignment between the incentives of actors in the system to focus on the capture of value instead of the creation of it.  Therefore regenerative cryptoeconomic systems aim for symmetry between value creation & value capture.

Robust Signal Emission

Robust Signal Generation

User Engagement Feedback Loop

Of course, in order to create a robust set of signals, one needs to have an active ecosystem of participants.

&#x20;feedback loop of user engagement is designed to keep users engaged by triggering their interest to perform some action, for when they are given a reward + are prompted to make further investment of time or other resources.

When onboarding users into a system, cryptoeconomic or otherwise, be careful to balance between challenge and skill.  Too far to one side, and the user gets bored.  Too far to another, and they get frustrated.

Reward Types

As users become more immersed in systems, cryptoeconomic or otherwise, different types of rewards can be deployed at different times in the funnel.

ImpactDAO

A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization; some DAOs are like global companies.  Some are protocols. All of them use blockchains as a trust anchor.&#x20;

Kleros- Dispute Resolution

Multisig Wallets - Multisig wallets allow a group of n people to control the actions of a cryptocurrency wallet if m of the n people agree on a single transaction, on a transaction by transaction basis.&#x20;

Worker co-ops - A co op is a group of workers who have united to meet their common needs and operations through a jointly owned enterperise.  Co-ops have been around for a while, but what is new in web3 is the opportunity to allow them to hit webscale or go global.

Data co-ops - A group organized for sharing pooled data from online consumers between two or more companies.  Within a data co op, members offer their data to the collective - which creates an opportunity for more economic leverage for the sale of one’s data than any individual collective member could have.. &#x20;

Voting Mechanisms

Ranked Choice Voting- an electoral system in which voters rank candidates by preference on their ballots. &#x20;

&#x20;

If a candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, he or she is declared the winner.&#x20;

If no candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, a candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated. First-preference votes cast for the failed candidate are eliminated, elevating the second-preference choices indicated on those ballots.&#x20;

A new tally is conducted to determine whether any candidate has won a majority of the adjusted votes.&#x20;

The process is repeated until a candidate wins an outright majority.

&#x20;

Quadratic Voting - a collective decision-making procedure which involves individuals allocating votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences. By allowing the voting mecahnism to take into account the degree of prefrences, a more optimal expression of preferences can be achieved.

&#x20;

Conviction Voting offers a novel decision making process that funds proposals based on the aggregated preference of community members, expressed continuously. By allowing the voting mecahnism to take into account conviction, a more optimal expression of preferences can be achieved.

Mechanisms cont’d

Staking - a way of putting tokens at risk in order to express conviction in a specific thing (at an individual level) or secure a system (at a system level).  Staked funds are subject to slashing if stakers or they objects they stake upon misbehave.

What Are Coordination Failures- systemic risks to human thriving (Moloch)&#x20;

Coordination failure occurs when a group of humans could achieve a desirable outcome by working together, but fail to do so because they don’t coordinate their decision making.

Examples of coordination failure

Nation-states refuse to give up Nuclear Arms because they want to defend themselves, despite the existential threat they pose to the world.&#x20;

Consumers refuse to give up fossil fuel-powered services because they want to get around conveniently, despite the existential threat fossil fuel burning imposes on the world.

Users of Open Source Software consume Open Source Software because they want to build things faster, despite the burnout that cumulative use imposes on OSS maintainers.

Individual cells of the human body live harmoniously pooling their resources for the greater good of the organism; but if a cell defects from this equilibrium, it becomes cancerous—eventually outcompeting all the other cells and taking over the body.

Coordination failure can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, if one firm decides a recession is imminent and fires its workers, other firms might lose demand from the lay-offs & then respond by firing their own workers—leading to a recession.

dictatorless dystopias, situations that each citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures regardless.&#x20;

non rivalrous (my consuming it does not stop you from consuming it) and non excludable (one cannot put clean air behind a velvet rope and charge for it), there is no business model- each individual actor has a rational incentive to free ride on the system. Why contribute back to a fund the maintenance of this software if I already get it for free? This is the first trap: the single player trap.

If enough actors choose to free ride, the entire system begins to bear a burden, and if that burden increases to a point of systemic collapse, no one gets these public goods. This is the second trap: the multiplayer trap.

Obvious solution is for everyone to do their part to support—but without a coordination mechanism that makes it rational for everyone to contribute, they do not.

We face global coordination failures

Climate Change is a coordination failure. As individual actors in the world economy, we make decisions everyday to achieve our individual goals.  But the actions we take can cause carbon to be emitted, and over time, the collective begins feel the consequences of this - through floods, fires, or increasing global temperatures.

&#x20;

An underfunded & insecure digital infrastructure is a coordination failure. As individual actors in the information ecosystem, we make decisions everyday about what information to consume.  Rarely do we think about the free & open source software that underpins that infrastructure.  Our global digital infrastructure is not well-funded by governments, as traditional infrastructure is. And those free & open source software providers often do not have a business model - this creates a systemic lack of investment in maintenance of digital infrastructure at precisely a time in which we are increasingly dependant upon it.

&#x20;

There’s many many more:  misinformation, inadequate access to education, inadequate access to employment, overfishing, the loss of biodiversity, are all coordination failures.

What’s at stake?

When your coastal property floods due to climate change, when an authoritarian is elected to power due to misinformation, when a hospital is held hostage by ransomware because of an insecure internet, each of these create human suffering . &#x20;

&#x20;

This local suffering is caused by global coordination failure.  The scale of the impact of these coordination failures is global, but the impact is local.

Gamification

Byzantine Generals Problem

The Byzantine Generals problem describes the difficulty that decentralized systems have in agreeing on a single truth - and was a problem that plagued monetary systems for a long time until the invention of Bitcoin.

The mechanism that started it all

Uncoordinated Attack

Leading to Defeat

The game theory behind this problem is as follows:  Several generals are besieging a town called Byzantium.  They have surrounded the city, but they must collectively decide to attack.  If all of the generals attack at the same time, they win.  But if they attack at different times, they lose.  The messages between the generals may have been intercepted and deceptively sent by their enemies.  How can the generals organize to solve the problem?

&#x20;In order to add information (or  blocks), to the blockchain, a member of the network must publish proof that they invested work into creating the block. This work imposes large costs on the creator, and thus incentivizes them to publish honest information. Because the rules are objective, there can be no disagreement or meddling with the information. The ruleset governing which transactions are valid and which are invalid is also objective, as is the system for determining who can mint new bitcoin

Byzantine Generals’ Problem

Coordinated Attack

Leading to Victory

If each player has chosen a strategy & no player can increase their own expected payoff by changing their strategy while the other players keep their own strategies unchanged, then it can be said that set of strategy choices constitutes a Nash equilibrium.

If a unique Nash equilibrium exists for a game, then all players can be rationally expected to converge to the state represented by the equilibrium

The Prisoners Dilemma

The Prisoners Dilemma is a category of coordination game where the incentives of players diverge - and without a mechanism for coordination between players, a rational player will choose their own benefit at expense of other players.

Here’s how it works: Imagine two members of a criminal organization are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner has no means of communicating with the other.&#x20;

Suppose the prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the primary charge, but they have enough to convict both on a secondary charge.&#x20;

Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by supply evidence that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

If player A and player B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison

If player A betrays player B but player B remains silent, player A will be set free and player B will serve 3 years in prison

If player A remains silent but player B betrays player A, player A will serve 3 years in prison and player B will be set free

If player A and player B both remain silent, both of them will serve only 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge).

As betraying the other player offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners without the ability to coordinate will betray the other. Only mutual cooperation would yield greater reward - but with no way to coordinate towards that, it is not likely to happen.

ZERO Sum Games

A zero-sum game is a type of game in game theory where if one party loses, the other party wins,  And visa versa.&#x20;

Zero-sum games can include only 2 players or many many participants.&#x20;

In financial markets, the investment mechanisms futures & options are considered zero-sum games.  This is because the contracts represent agreements between 2 parties and, if 1 investor loses the wealth is transferred to another investor.  In a zero-sum game, it is not possible for one party to advance its position w/o the other party suffering an equal and opposite loss.

Positive Sum Games

"Positive-sum" games, in game theory, are those games in which the sum of winnings & losses is greater than zero (net positive).&#x20;

LIke Zero-sum games, Positive-sum games can include just two players or many many participants.&#x20;

In positive sum games, it is possible for multiple parties (or all parties) to mutually benefit.  As Regenerative Cryptoeconomics emphasizes games that are net-positive, it often involves designing positive sum games.

When Designing Coordination Games

To build mechanisms that are not fragile, design for mechanisms that are easier to defend than to attack  (eg cheaper to coordinate than to defect).

The Matthew Effect

The Matthew Effect of accumulated advantage,  is sometimes summarized by the adage "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer".&#x20;

The concept is applicable to the cumulative advantage of economic capital - but can also apply to matters of fame or status or other types of resources.

Because the Matthew Effect is a repeatable pattern in human social systems, economic systems will typically consolidate in the hands of a rich elite.

Beating the Matthew Effect

The Matthew Effect is a fundamental law of economic systems, but that doesn’t mean that it cannot be mitigated.

By building Regenerative Cryptoeconomic systems that (1) do not externalize harm (2) favor one-person-one-vote instead of one-token-one-vote or (3) leverage other regenerative mechanisms,&#x20;

&#x20;

Many Regenerative Cryptoeconomic problems attempt to solve these problems by creating efficiency, verifiability, & scale in administering funding campaigns.

Free Rider Problem

If you give people the choice to support public goods or not, rationally self-interested people without a coordination mechanism will often free ride on public goods.If enough people free ride, the whole system collapses due to lack of support.This is why many Regenerative Cryptoeconomic problems attempt to solve the free rider problem.

Decentralization- Hierarchies Over History

As technological evolution exponentially compounds, and our democratic institutions evolve on a much slower timescale than the technology that is powering the choices of citizens (or consumers) that participate in government, we have seen massive disillusionment on behalf of individuals who feel that he system no longer works for them.

In political science, the idea of the consent of the governed is foundational.  A government’s legitimacy and moral right to use its power is only justified (and lawful) when consented to by the people or society in which that political power is exercised. &#x20;

One problem with the powerful web2 platforms is that they do not seek the consent of their userbase for any of the changes that they roll out to the platform, nor do they allow their users to exit the system without a high cost.&#x20;

Conflict resolution mechanisms

Legitimacy&#x20;



Legitimacy is a pattern that emerges naturally in many coordination games, and it informs each agent in a coordination’s mental model for what they can expect other agents to do.

The ways legitimacy is created or destroyed are:

Legitimacy by brute force

Legitimacy by continuity

Legitimacy by fairness

Legitimacy by process

Legitimacy by performance

Legitimacy by participation

Legitimacy by process
