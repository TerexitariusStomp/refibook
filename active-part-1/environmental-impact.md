# Environmental Impact

Cryptocurrency (short form: crypto) is a controversial technology. Countries have banned cryptocurrency mining, the ability to have cryptocurrency, or even be affiliated with it. Tesla not accepting cryptocurrency as payment until it is ran on at least 50% renewable energy, made a lot of people think about the environmental impact of cryptocurrency. In order for crypto to increase it's adoption rate, it must address this issue.&#x20;

The two main environmental impacts of crypto are energy use and electronic waste. Currencies have environmental impacts of energy and electronic waste as well. This writing will focus only on the environmental impact of energy use for minting new units of value (bitcoin or dollars and coinage). It won't take into account the energy cost of disposing of old currencies, transportation and growing of materials, chemicals used, water used, environmental impact of metals, deforestation, greenhouse gases, e-waste, microplastics from polymer notes or bank cards, among many other impacts (1, 2). Unlike other writing that compared crypto's environmental impact to countries, this writing will compare it with currency (specifically US currencies; dollars and coinage).&#x20;

The Euro, USD and Yen, account for 60% of the circulating currency in the world (McCook, 2014). This takes shape as around 5.25 million tonnes of coinage and at least 200 billion bank notes (McCook, 2014). For this writing take into consideration that the calculations account for only around 20% of the energy use of circulating currency.&#x20;

Minting United States currency (dollars and coinage) uses up to 10 times the amount of energy that Bitcoin uses and lasts a fraction of the time. Coins on average last 25 years (McCook, 2014)). While cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, could theoretically last forever.&#x20;

1: Though to give you an idea of the environmental impact of this from US currency it is estimated that 1.75 billion litres per year of water is used, 6 million pounds of waste ink and pulp sludge is produced, 3,540 tonnes of ink is used, over 7,100 tonnes of cotton, and over 2,300 tonnes of linen (McCook 2014).&#x20;

2: Bitcoin's annual e-waste generation adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons as of May 2021 (De Vries, 2021). A measurement of the amount of e-waste that the US currency system produces was unable to be found. However, there's an estimated 800,000 bank branches with at least a computer in each one and around 3.24 million ATMs globally (IMF, 2020; Finextra, 2019)

## Fiat Energy Use

_The US lost around USD $870,000,000 producing pennies between 2010-2020 (estimating the cost of producing pennies during that time at around 2.1 cents) (Unser, 2022)_

From 2010 to 2020 there was an estimated USD $794,136,900 of pennies, $668,783,720 of nickels, $2,453,301,000 of dimes, $4,491,593,500 of quarters, $28,725,000 of 50 cent pieces, and $1,001,230,000 of dollar pieces, $24,044,800,000 of one dollars, $1,075,200,000 of two dollars, $35,648,000,000 of five dollars, $46,910,000,000 of ten dollars, $350,080,000,000 of twenty dollars, $121,600,000,000 of fifty dollars, and $1,941,120,000,000 of one hundred dollars newly minted for a total of USD $2,529,915,770,120... around two and a half trillion dollars. That was created from 133,478,075,300 new units of value consisting of 794,136,900 pennies, 13,375,674,400 nickels, 24,533,010,000 dimes, 17,966,374,000 quarters, 57,450,000 half dollars, 1,001,230,000 dollar pieces, 24,044,800,000 dollar bills, 537,600,000 2 dollar bills, 7,129,600,000 5 dollar bills, 4,691,000,000 10 dollar bills, 17,504,000,000 20 dollar bills, 2,432,000,000 50 dollar bills, and 19,411,200,000 100 dollar bills (BEP, 2020; USMint 2022).&#x20;

0.00000001672947013 GWh are used on average to print a bill at the minting site (Ahlers et al. 2010). 75,750,200,000 of the newly minted units above were bills. That means 1,267 GWh was used to print bills between 2010 and 2020.&#x20;

Coinage varies on energy needed based on the metals used; zinc, copper, and nickel are the three base metals used (for metals percentage of each coin see (GoldSilver, 2020)). From 2010 to 2020 there was 213,375 tons of zinc, 226,584 tons of copper, and 32,849 tons of nickel used. These metals could of originated from mined metals (maximum energy needed) or recycled metals (minimum energy needed). It is estimated that recycling can reduce the energy needed by 95% (Federal Metals, 2022). In terms of energy, GWh, per ton needed to mine metals; zinc is .0018, copper is .0099 and nickel is .0019 (Donahue, 2016). Once metals are able to be used it takes around 0.00000258 GWh per coin (Goldstein, 2017). Only counting the mining process it would take around GWh 384 for zinc, 2,243 for copper and 62 for nickel to mine the metals necessary. Of the newly minted units described above 57,727,875,300 of those were coinage. That means 148,937 GWh were used to turn these metals into coins. For a total of 151626 GWh for coinage... around 150,000 GWh. Combining that with the energy used to print bills leads to around 153,000 GWh of energy use.&#x20;

## Crypto Energy Use

Different methodologies have been used to calculate Bitcoin energy consumption. Without going into detail about these methodologies but rather relying on the prestige of the name of the university that produced the result, Cambridge. During 2010-2020 cryptocurrency used at max 17,400 GWh and at minimum 4,000 GWh (Cambridge, 2022). By the end of 2020 there was 18.59 million Bitcoin in circulation, out of the total number that will ever exist of 21 million (de Best, 2022).  Bitcoin is able to store small units of value, micro pennies to large units of value trillions of dollars. In addition to this, Bitcoin can be used globally by any entity that would like to transact with it.&#x20;

The two major proof of work cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) have had scaling solutions built on top of them (such as lightning network with Bitcoin, and Polygon with Ethereum). Utilizing these scaling solutions for transactions allows for the energy demand to be greatly reduced.&#x20;



Of the energy used in Bitcoin mining renewable energy is used to power anywhere from 40-75% of it (NYTimes, 2021). The Crypto Climate Accord has been started with more than 250 companies and individuals spanning the crypto and finance, technology, NGO, and energy and climate sectors signing stating that they would like to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity consumption by 2030 (CryptoClimate, 2022). This combined by the market incentive for renewable energy (some of the cheapest sources of energy in the world come from renewables) will likely make the percentage of renewable energy for Bitcoin mining go towards the range of >75%. &#x20;

## Proof of Stake

Everything so far has only been about the first decentralized cryptocurrency ever, Bitcoin uses proof of work. Since then there has been a lot of innovation towards efficiency. One innovation is proof of stake (POS). Proof of stake uses a thousandth the energy need of Bitcoin, with some of the most efficient using the equivalent of seven US households worth of energy (CCRI, 2022). Proof of stake networks are able to be run on computers as simple as a Raspberry Pi.&#x20;

## Future

Carbon neutral Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies are becoming an ever increasing trend with Ripple, WAX, Solana, Polygon, Celo, Near, among others jumping on board. Algorand even went so far as to go carbon negative. This was largely made possible by offsetting carbon impact through carbon credits, with around 25 million carbon credits now on blockchains (Rosseau, 2022).&#x20;

One of the major proof of work blockchains, Ethereum, is in the process of transitioning to a proof of stake algorithm which would reduce the network energy demand by 99% (Castor, 2022).&#x20;
