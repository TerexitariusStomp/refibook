# Web3

`Currently web3 is ran on web2, though web3 could be done through carrier pigeons, smoke signals, or wire fences.`&#x20;

The internet is now highly utilized globally for education, healthcare, business opportunities, etc. Phones are connecting to the internet, allowing global communication and TV has largely now shifted to being an app (Netflix for example) that one can access via their internet connection. There are five components to the web.&#x20;

![There are five components to the web; physical (A), data (B), applications (C), internet (D), and transport (E).](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

## Physical

&#x20;Physical is the hardware that is needed for the internet; usually a laptop, TV and a phone. However, there is a hidden layer.&#x20;

## Data&#x20;

Whenever a person interacts with the physical component, moves a mouse, touches a keyboard, speaks into a phone, turns on their TV data is generated. This data is structured and stored within the physical. There will be an estimated 175 zettabytes of data needed to be stored by 2025 (1). Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook currently collectively store at least 1.2 zettabytes in their physical components (data storage systems) (2). This data is analyzed by each of these companies adding an additional layer to the physical components (computing systems). &#x20;

## Applications

One way in which people on the internet interact with data is in the form of applications. Well known application examples are the search engine of Google or Facebook's social media app.&#x20;

## Internet&#x20;

Once the data is generated, people want to communicate with other people about it. The sending of this data from person to person, is the foundation of the internet. There are different ways in which this data is structured to make it legible for the person on the other side, such as IP addresses.

## Transport&#x20;

Structuring is just one part of sending data, the other aspect is the actual infrastructure needed to do so. Fiber networks, cables able to send data to and from parts of the world at high speeds, span throughout our world. Satellite systems, such as [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/), are also able to transport this data. &#x20;

## Problems with Web2

### Physical

In North Korea the physical components that people are able to purchase easily are heavily modified so that North Korea can control what data their population has access to and easilly access the data that the population creates (3). This control of the physical layer is able to be replicated in other parts of the world and likely has.&#x20;

Lenovo, HP Inc and Dell have over 50% of the global PC market share (4). Microsoft has strategic alliances and partnerships with each of these companies, increasing the reach of Microsoft to at least 50% of PCs in terms of hardware. The operating systems installed on the physical layers of computers are around 90% of the time from Microsoft (5).&#x20;

### Data

If you have used the physical layer large tech companies of Google, Microsoft, Apple (phones and computers) or If you have interacted with applications like search engines (Google, Yahoo) or applications like Facebook it is likely that your data is stored in one of their data centers. Once the data is stored, these companies are able to monetize off your data. Potential revenue sources includes selling it to advertisers, governments, or other entities interested in using it. These companies themselves have made some of the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems in the world (such as Google Translate). People can access these AI's however they have not been paid for the use of their data.   &#x20;

If you have used the physical layer of Google, Microsoft (phones and computers) or if you interacted with the search engine (Yahoo) or application (Facebook) your data it is likely that your data is stored in one of these data centers (6).&#x20;

### Applications

Google and Meta (Facebook) alone have influence on greater than 70% of internet traffic, the remaining 30% is shared by all other apps and sites (7). If you search- lawsuits Google or lawsuits Facebook you can see just how many lawsuits these companies are in. The lawsuits range from privacy infringements, to theft of intellectual property, to discrimination, to genocide, to damaging youth's health, etc. Again, these companies control 70% of the internet, that's around 70% of the world's data transmissions...&#x20;

Applications have regularly occurring outages and or delays. Big tech giants like Microsoft, Reddit and Snapchat are also subject to these outages.&#x20;

![Application outages for the last 24 hours, retrieved on 6/19/22 (9).](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

### Internet

Between 2018 and 2020 there were anywhere from 155-213 government-induced internet shutdowns in 25-33 different countries (10). We hear stories of the great Chinese firewall, but the reality is all over the world individuals are being censored and having surveillance placed upon them by governments (11).&#x20;

![Censorship and surveillance by country 2018 (12)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

The level of internet censorship ranges from short term blackouts and disruptions, to persistent multi-month or multi- year blackouts and disruptions, to somewhat restrictive long-term controls with disruption surges, to highly restrictive long-term structural controls (13). On average an internet outage costs per person anywhere from USD $0.06-$2.36 per day (14). To give one example, in 2022 to today (6/19/22), Russia's internet outage has cost them USD $6,770,000,000 (15). &#x20;

![Internet Outages in last 24 hours taken on 6/19/22 (16).](<../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)

One company, Level 3 (acquired by Lumen Technologies), handles sending data to and from (through IP addresses and ASes) just under 80% of the conventional internet (17). This company has been accused of wiretapping Google, Yahoo, and a German Internet Exchange Point on behalf of the National Security Administration of the US (17). Other major companies in this domain (IP addresses and ASes) manage a slight percentage in comparison to Level 3 (such as Cogent, Global Telecom and Technology, TeliaSonera International Carrier, NTT Communications, Tata Communications, Telecom Italia Sparkle). However, they have been caught up in similar legal ordeals. Such as TeliaSonera collaborating with certain dictatorships, allowing them to spy on their citizens, and in 2012 they were investigated for bribery and money laundering in Uzbekistan (17).

## Transport

A complex system of fiber cables, satellites, receivers and transmitters transports data globally. Rodents often represent a more practical threat to these systems than cyber attackers (18, 19). Though signal jamming can still take place by entities, including governments. There are many different businesses involved in transport.&#x20;

## Centralization of the Web

4 companies are able to access and utilize anywhere from 70-90% of data on the internet. This creates a dangerous level of centralization. These companies are able to influence governments to individuals in the way they access, interact with and transmit data. Governments can block the data being transmitted and cater it to their liking for the population, which is already done globally. Allowing corporations and governments to control the flow of data allows select individuals to have disproportionate power as compared to the rest of the population. If the top apps were to pay you for the data you generate when using them (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, etc.), you'd get around $2,000 a year (20). At the same time it would take the average Facebook user alone being paid over $1,000 a year to stop using Facebook (21).&#x20;

Web3 layers have

·        Data storage layer

·        Consensus layer

·        End-Use Layer

·        Data Traffic Layer

While PoW and PoS are by far the most prevalent in the blockchain space, there are other consensus algorithms like [Proof of Capacity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-capacity-cryptocurrency.asp) (PoC) which allow sharing of memory space of the contributing nodes on the blockchain network. The more memory or hard disk space a node has, the more rights it is granted for maintaining the public ledger.

[Proof of Burn](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-burn-cryptocurrency.asp) (PoB) is another that requires transactors to send small amounts of cryptocurrency to inaccessible wallet addresses, in effect "burning" them out of existence.

Mesh networks allow users to maintain communications with one another without relying on the internet or SMS services; instead, they leverage Bluetooth or Wi-Fi technology to create a chain of devices that can send messages to one another when they are in the same vicinity
