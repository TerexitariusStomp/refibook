# DAOs

In the legacy world, many public goods (if they are maintained at all) are bundled into a handful nation-state government.  In the digital world, public goods can be unbundled into many DAOS that interoperate with one another

ImpactDAO

A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization; some DAOs are like global companies.  Some are protocols. All of them use blockchains as a trust anchor.

Multisig Wallets - Multisig wallets allow a group of n people to control the actions of a cryptocurrency wallet if m of the n people agree on a single transaction, on a transaction by transaction basis.&#x20;

Worker co-ops - A co op is a group of workers who have united to meet their common needs and operations through a jointly owned enterperise.  Co-ops have been around for a while, but what is new in web3 is the opportunity to allow them to hit webscale or go global.

Data co-ops - A group organized for sharing pooled data from online consumers between two or more companies.  Within a data co op, members offer their data to the collective - which creates an opportunity for more economic leverage for the sale of oneâ€™s data than any individual collective member could have..  &#x20;

ImpactDAOs can stack

Each ImpactDAO benefits from all the stacked ImpactDAOs supporting their work.

Scalability: ImpactDAO stacking is how growth compounds, momentum builds, and regenerative cryptoeconomics eventually becomes inevitable.

Each DAO had its own mission, goals, and focus and tightly curated culture.&#x20;

&#x20;\- pluralism: skin to biodiversity.  The more pluralism there is  across an ecosystem, this creates more antifragility as it grows.

\- expressivity: eg the collection of primitives available should be reach enough to allow actors to express organizations we've not thought of yet.

\- simplicity/legibility: individual primitives should be relatively simple, you can combine them into more complex assemblages.&#x20;

\- standardization: a sufficiently large library of legible primitives that you can almost always find a known simple/legible component that meets your needs, will accelerate innovation.

\- modularity/composibility: this comes pretty naturally from simplicity and standardization, and assuming you collection of primitives is sufficiently expressive you can create assemblages that do just about anything.
