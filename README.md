# Introduction

An inchoate virtous cycle

All coordination is a choice.  To win this coordination game, we need to choose to coordinate to make this into a multiplayer game.  Once the multiplayer game is bootstrapped, we need to choose coordinate to win it.  Once we win it, we must coordinate to maintain its legitimacy. &#x20;

We do these things not for their own sake, but as a means to create human thriving. If we collectively all take the green pill, we create a more solarpunk world.  If we collectively do not, we continue to maintain the status quo.  Regenerative CryptoEconomics is here, it’s important, and it’s happening.  But it is also inchoate.  To grow, it needs you.

The overton window is open.  Join the movement. Do what your skills & abilities uniquely enable you to do.  Spread the word.  Build something.  Learn from your mistakes, & throw it out & build something else.  Host a meetup.  Be honest about where we’re winning & also where we fall short.  Do what feels right to you. Do your own research. Beware any charistmatic leader who claims to have all the answers (including me).  The leader is the person who knows what to do next.

&#x20;

And whatever you do, remember to coordinate.
