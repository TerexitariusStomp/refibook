**How Superstorm Sandy looked to the internet**

When Superstorm Sandy hit New Jersey in October 2012, it knocked a number of computers off the internet. A team of computer scientists at the University of Michigan had recently built [ZMap](https://zmap.io/), a tool that allowed them to scan every computer on the internet in less than an hour. That allowed them to make this map, which shows locations where the number of web servers running the SSL encryption software declined by 30 percent or more, which turns out to be a good proxy for heavy storm damage.
