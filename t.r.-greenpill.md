Embodying the Externalities

Economic incentive for switching to renewable energy for proof of work

Coordination failure occurs when a group of humans could achieve a desirable outcome by working together, but fail to do so because they don’t coordinate their decision making.

Examples of coordination failure

Nation-states refuse to give up Nuclear Arms because they want to defend themselves, despite the existential threat they pose to the world.&#x20;

Consumers refuse to give up fossil fuel-powered services because they want to get around conveniently, despite the existential threat fossil fuel burning imposes on the world.

Users of Open Source Software consume Open Source Software because they want to build things faster, despite the burnout that cumulative use imposes on OSS maintainers.

Individual cells of the human body live harmoniously pooling their resources for the greater good of the organism; but if a cell defects from this equilibrium, it becomes cancerous—eventually outcompeting all the other cells and taking over the body.

Coordination failure can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, if one firm decides a recession is imminent and fires its workers, other firms might lose demand from the lay-offs & then respond by firing their own workers—leading to a recession.

dictatorless dystopias, situations that each citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures regardless.&#x20;

non rivalrous (my consuming it does not stop you from consuming it) and non excludable (one cannot put clean air behind a velvet rope and charge for it), there is no business model- each individual actor has a rational incentive to free ride on the system. Why contribute back to a fund the maintenance of this software if I already get it for free? This is the first trap: the single player trap.

If enough actors choose to free ride, the entire system begins to bear a burden, and if that burden increases to a point of systemic collapse, no one gets these public goods. This is the second trap: the multiplayer trap.

Obvious solution is for everyone to do their part to support—but without a coordination mechanism that makes it rational for everyone to contribute, they do not.

We face global coordination failures

Climate Change is a coordination failure. As individual actors in the world economy, we make decisions everyday to achieve our individual goals.  But the actions we take can cause carbon to be emitted, and over time, the collective begins feel the consequences of this - through floods, fires, or increasing global temperatures.

&#x20;

An underfunded & insecure digital infrastructure is a coordination failure. As individual actors in the information ecosystem, we make decisions everyday about what information to consume.  Rarely do we think about the free & open source software that underpins that infrastructure.  Our global digital infrastructure is not well-funded by governments, as traditional infrastructure is. And those free & open source software providers often do not have a business model - this creates a systemic lack of investment in maintenance of digital infrastructure at precisely a time in which we are increasingly dependant upon it.

&#x20;

There’s many many more:  misinformation, inadequate access to education, inadequate access to employment, overfishing, the loss of biodiversity, are all coordination failures.

What’s at stake?

When your coastal property floods due to climate change, when an authoritarian is elected to power due to misinformation, when a hospital is held hostage by ransomware because of an insecure internet, each of these create human suffering . &#x20;

&#x20;

This local suffering is caused by global coordination failure.  The scale of the impact of these coordination failures is global, but the impact is local.

&#x20;https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/

All coordination is a choice. What we choose to do when presented that choice is up to us.

immutable - so that if the founder of a web3 protocol turns evil, then the  protocol itself cannot change.

transparent - all code & state is viewable by everyone equally.

decentralized - cannot be captured by anyone.

programmable - so it can be used to create coordination via novel mechanism design.

global - equally accessible from anywhere in the world.

In the past, Trust Networks were local, trust was oriented around relationships which were based upon our geographic locations. On the internet, we have niche interests, and our networks of relationships are built around them.

We can now Build Global Trust Networks

Niches are the new nation states.  Each niche has its own network of participants, and could one day have infrastructure for public good build around these global trust networks. Back to Global to Hyperlocal

Spiral Dynamics describes how worldviews & value systems emerge from the interaction of life conditions & the people in them.  Each value system is neither positive or negative, but is a response to the local environment.  Each value system may also be a response to the problems of the previous system.

Memes- Holistic Meme, Integrative Meme

Hierarchies Over History

As technological evolution exponentially compounds, and our democratic institutions evolve on a much slower timescale than the technology that is powering the choices of citizens (or consumers) that participate in government, we have seen massive disillusionment on behalf of individuals who feel that he system no longer works for them.

[https://g0v.asia/](https://g0v.asia/)&#x20;

&#x20;https://www.radicalxchange.org/

In political science, the idea of the consent of the governed is foundational.  A government’s legitimacy and moral right to use its power is only justified (and lawful) when consented to by the people or society in which that political power is exercised. &#x20;

One problem with the powerful web2 platforms is that they do not seek the consent of their userbase for any of the changes that they roll out to the platform, nor do they allow their users to exit the system without a high cost.&#x20;

&#x20;Forking

Solarpunk is optimistic and fundamentally “high tech” and “high life”. It emphasizes a deep integration between, rather than separation of, technology and the environment in addition to convivial conservation, self-sustainability, and social inclusiveness.

If each player has chosen a strategy & no player can increase their own expected payoff by changing their strategy while the other players keep their own strategies unchanged, then it can be said that set of strategy choices constitutes a Nash equilibrium.

If a unique Nash equilibrium exists for a game, then all players can be rationally expected to converge to the state represented by the equilibrium

The Prisoners Dilemma

The Prisoners Dilemma is a category of coordination game where the incentives of players diverge - and without a mechanism for coordination between players, a rational player will choose their own benefit at expense of other players.

Here’s how it works: Imagine two members of a criminal organization are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner has no means of communicating with the other.&#x20;

Suppose the prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the primary charge, but they have enough to convict both on a secondary charge.&#x20;

Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by supply evidence that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

If player A and player B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison

If player A betrays player B but player B remains silent, player A will be set free and player B will serve 3 years in prison

If player A remains silent but player B betrays player A, player A will serve 3 years in prison and player B will be set free

If player A and player B both remain silent, both of them will serve only 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge).

As betraying the other player offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners without the ability to coordinate will betray the other. Only mutual cooperation would yield greater reward - but with no way to coordinate towards that, it is not likely to happen.

ZERO Sum Games

A zero-sum game is a type of game in game theory where if one party loses, the other party wins,  And visa versa.&#x20;

Zero-sum games can include only 2 players or many many participants.&#x20;

In financial markets, the investment mechanisms futures & options are considered zero-sum games.  This is because the contracts represent agreements between 2 parties and, if 1 investor loses the wealth is transferred to another investor.  In a zero-sum game, it is not possible for one party to advance its position w/o the other party suffering an equal and opposite loss.

Positive Sum Games

"Positive-sum" games, in game theory, are those games in which the sum of winnings & losses is greater than zero (net positive).&#x20;

LIke Zero-sum games, Positive-sum games can include just two players or many many participants.&#x20;

In positive sum games, it is possible for multiple parties (or all parties) to mutually benefit.  As Regenerative Cryptoeconomics emphasizes games that are net-positive, it often involves designing positive sum games.

When incentive systems are aligned, more economic agents will take the aligned actions than before.

What if we could align the incentive systems between public, private, and common goods to create more human thriving?

When Designing Coordination Games

To build mechanisms that are not fragile, design for mechanisms that are easier to defend than to attack  (eg cheaper to coordinate than to defect).

The Matthew Effect

The Matthew Effect of accumulated advantage,  is sometimes summarized by the adage "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer".&#x20;

The concept is applicable to the cumulative advantage of economic capital - but can also apply to matters of fame or status or other types of resources.

Because the Matthew Effect is a repeatable pattern in human social systems, economic systems will typically consolidate in the hands of a rich elite.

Beating the Matthew Effect

The Matthew Effect is a fundamental law of economic systems, but that doesn’t mean that it cannot be mitigated.

By building Regenerative Cryptoeconomic systems that (1) do not externalize harm (2) favor one-person-one-vote instead of one-token-one-vote or (3) leverage other regenerative mechanisms,&#x20;

&#x20;

Many Regenerative Cryptoeconomic problems attempt to solve these problems by creating efficiency, verifiability, & scale in administering funding campaigns.

Free Rider Problem

If you give people the choice to support public goods or not, rationally self-interested people without a coordination mechanism will often free ride on public goods.If enough people free ride, the whole system collapses due to lack of support.This is why many Regenerative Cryptoeconomic problems attempt to solve the free rider problem.

Conflict resolution mechanisms



Legitimacy is a pattern that emerges naturally in many coordination games, and it informs each agent in a coordination’s mental model for what they can expect other agents to do.

The ways legitimacy is created or destroyed are:

Legitimacy by brute force

Legitimacy by continuity

Legitimacy by fairness

Legitimacy by process

Legitimacy by performance

Legitimacy by participation

Legitimacy by process

&#x20;https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html

In the legacy world, many public goods (if they are maintained at all) are bundled into a handful nation-state government.  In the digital world, public goods can be unbundled into many DAOS that interoperate with one another

Fiat Currency Vs. Cryptocurrency&#x20;

The root problem with conventional (fiat) currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. A central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, each individual bank must not lie about its balances - but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.

Byzantine Generals Problem

The Byzantine Generals problem describes the difficulty that decentralized systems have in agreeing on a single truth - and was a problem that plagued monetary systems for a long time until the invention of Bitcoin.

The mechanism that started it all

Uncoordinated Attack

Leading to Defeat

The game theory behind this problem is as follows:  Several generals are besieging a town called Byzantium.  They have surrounded the city, but they must collectively decide to attack.  If all of the generals attack at the same time, they win.  But if they attack at different times, they lose.  The messages between the generals may have been intercepted and deceptively sent by their enemies.  How can the generals organize to solve the problem?

&#x20;In order to add information (or  blocks), to the blockchain, a member of the network must publish proof that they invested work into creating the block. This work imposes large costs on the creator, and thus incentivizes them to publish honest information. Because the rules are objective, there can be no disagreement or meddling with the information. The ruleset governing which transactions are valid and which are invalid is also objective, as is the system for determining who can mint new bitcoin

Funding Generation Mechanisms

&#x20;

Sequencer Fees - The Optimism L2 network has pledged to donate 100% of their early sequencer fees to the public good of the Ethereum network.  Since Optimism does $100k/day in sequencer fees, this has been a very successful way of funding public goods.

&#x20;

Transaction Fees - Prominent DEFI Protocols have implemened fee switches into their protocols, which if turned on, could be a power funding generation mechanism for the public good.

&#x20;

Web2 is funded by advertising, and web2 advertising networks like Facebook have become hugely profitable by selling advertising. What kind of new opportunities would it provide to fund regenerative economics to give everyday citiens of the web the ability to route economic upside for their data?&#x20;

&#x20;

Any other economically exothermic mechanism - Any other mechanism that’s used in DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, or otherwise to generate protocol revenue could be directed to public goods.

111

&#x20;

&#x20;

Quadratic Funding -  a way to allocate the distribution of funds (for example, from a government's budget, a philanthropic source, or collected directly from participants) based on quadratic voting (defined on the next page).

&#x20;

Retroactive Public Goods Funding - A scheme to retroactively reward those who have contributed to public goods based upon what a group of domain experts vote on. The core principle behind the concept of retroactive public goods funding is simple: it’s easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful.

&#x20;

MolochDAO - A Minimum Viable DAO design that invented a “ragequit” - a means for members to exit the DAO by exchanging their shares for a pro-rata claim on the treasury's assets. Ecosystem participants can fund a MolochDAOs & easily exit their funds via ragequit if they disagree w. the DAO’s decisions.

&#x20;

Web of Trust - The creation of a graph data structure of who trusts who, upon which data bout who is creating the most value can be gleaned.  This intersubjective data can be used to allocate tokens. Used by CoordinAPE, SourceCred.

&#x20;

Universal Basic Income -  a sociopolitical financial transfer concept in which all citizens of a given population regularly receive a legally equal financial grant without a means test.  Typically designed to give participants stable financial footing from whicih to pursue other goals.

&#x20;

Aqueduct- a conduit built to transfer water.  In the internet of money, aqueducts have been set up to directly transfer 1% to projects like Gitcoin, Radicle Drips, or the Protocol Guild.  Some projects that receive aqueducts decide to pay their revenues forward to other projects, creating a series of multi-level aqueducts.

Funding Distribution Mechanisms

112

&#x20;

&#x20;

Voting Mechanisms

Ranked Choice Voting- an electoral system in which voters rank candidates by preference on their ballots. &#x20;

&#x20;

If a candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, he or she is declared the winner.&#x20;

If no candidate wins a majority of first-preference votes, a candidate with the fewest first-preference votes is eliminated. First-preference votes cast for the failed candidate are eliminated, elevating the second-preference choices indicated on those ballots.&#x20;

A new tally is conducted to determine whether any candidate has won a majority of the adjusted votes.&#x20;

The process is repeated until a candidate wins an outright majority.

&#x20;

Quadratic Voting - a collective decision-making procedure which involves individuals allocating votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences. By allowing the voting mecahnism to take into account the degree of prefrences, a more optimal expression of preferences can be achieved.

&#x20;

Conviction Voting offers a novel decision making process that funds proposals based on the aggregated preference of community members, expressed continuously. By allowing the voting mecahnism to take into account conviction, a more optimal expression of preferences can be achieved.

113

&#x20;

&#x20;

Staking - a way of putting tokens at risk in order to express conviction in a specific thing (at an individual level) or secure a system (at a system level).  Staked funds are subject to slashing if stakers or they objects they stake upon misbehave.

&#x20;

Bonding Curve - A scheme in which the price of a token is determined by its supply. The more tokens that have been distributed, the higher the price + visa versa.  Typically used as an elegant mechanism to manage scarcity + price.

&#x20;

Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs) are assignable credit obligations redeemable for goods & services.  These can be issued by communities to develop sustainable local markets when National Currencies are scarce.&#x20;

&#x20;

Fractal DAO protocols, They make 'subsidiarity' easier to implement; Subsidiarity is critical for scalable informed participatory governance. Orca, 1hive Swarms are examples.

&#x20;

Natural Capital backed Assets. Strictly necessary to align regnerative finance with physical/natural world, not just social/economic world. CurveLabs and Kolectivo (formerly CuraDAO) are piloting these.

Multisig Wallets - Multisig wallets allow a group of n people to control the actions of a cryptocurrency wallet if m of the n people agree on a single transaction, on a transaction by transaction basis.&#x20;

&#x20;

Worker co-ops - A co op is a group of workers who have united to meet their common needs and operations through a jointly owned enterperise.  Co-ops have been around for a while, but what is new in web3 is the opportunity to allow them to hit webscale or go global.

&#x20;

Data co-ops - A group organized for sharing pooled data from online consumers between two or more companies.  Within a data co op, members offer their data to the collective - which creates an opportunity for more economic leverage for the sale of one’s data than any individual collective member could have.. &#x20;

&#x20;

Miner Extractable Value - the maximum amount of value that can be extracted from the block production process (in excess of the standard block rewards and fees).  Tangibly, this means that block producers can reorder transactions in order to front-run others transactions - which in some cases can lead to a lot of profit.

115

&#x20;

&#x20;

Harberger tax - a mechansim that allows an ecosystem to strike a balance between pure private ownership & total commons ownership of a resource. &#x20;

&#x20;

Citizens value their own property and pay tax on that value. A self-assessed tax.

At any point in time, anyone else can buy the property from you at that price, forcing a sale.

&#x20;

Lossless Lotteries - A way of running a lottery such that even if you do not win the lottery, you get to keep the price of admission into such lottery.  By allowing users to stake funds in a lottery, and then using those funds to generate yield and rewarding the winner of the lottery with those yields,  lossless lotteries are able to create a positive sum way of generating funds for winners (but without taking funds from the losers).

Unsolved Problems & Opportunities

Money Legos - Composability is the interoperability of different pieces of the internet of money such that they could be assembled like legos. Each new money lego is a freely available public good for any builder to use - creating an opportunity for each net-new builder in the space to “stand on the shoulders of giants”.   It’s what creates the conditions that allow for the creation of exponentially more unique combinations of mechanisms over time.&#x20;

&#x20;

Moving beyond 1:1 coin voting is an opportunity to create more cartel-resistant forms of governance. There are inequalities and incentive misalignments even in the absence of attackers (these systems can be dominated by the rich & powerful), and (outright attacks through various forms of (often obfuscated) vote buying in 1:1 coin voting systems.

&#x20;

Closing the gap between value creation & value capture remains a huge opportunity for funding public goods.  The more people can worry about value creation & less they worry about value capture from business models, the more they are focusing on the public good.  Mechanisms that measure value creation & reward participants for that value creation are possible with more objective (or intersubjective) measurement of value creation.

117

&#x20;

Unsolved Problems & Opportunities cont’d

Decentralized Reputation Systems - Because so much value transfer in the world depends on the reputation of the parties in the transaction, it could be argued that Identity is an important part of the internet of value.

&#x20;

When I get a job, I want to know who I am working with.

When I loan someone money, I want to know their history of repayments.

When I invest in a company, I want to know the founder’s reputation to understand their character.

When I get into an Uber, I want to know that my driver’s reputation is free of major incidents.

When I log in to my social feed, I want to know the credibility of the content/authors I see.

&#x20;

Proof of Personhood - If we could find a cryptoeconomic way to prove unique human-ness, we could move the internet of finance from “one token one vote” to “one human one vote” and unleash a wave of digital democracy. With proof of personhood, the ecosystem could move to DAOs built on one-human-one-vote. This unlocks use cases like:

quadratic funding

one-person-one-vote  or quadratic votingDAOs

Gini coefficient measurements

UBI

\+ other use cases we havent discovered yet!

118

&#x20;

&#x20;

Privacy! Privacy! Privacy! - To prevent many dystopian outcomes, Privacy must be baked in to these mechanisms from the start. &#x20;

&#x20;

The old world model of privacy is broken. The new world privacy model will be built around zero knowledge proofs, eg you will be able to prove attributes about yourself without revealing any more personal information about yourselves.

&#x20;

Persistent Pseudonomous Identities will be a thing -- People will need practical ways to let people build deep long standing reputations without practically doxxing their real world identities.  Organically, ETH addresses with long complex history of transactions, NFTs and ENS are nice but its time frame, frequency and diversity transactions that are hard to fake / duplicate.

Other unsolved problems may exist, especially in systems with :

High wealth inequality

High levles of plutocracy or collusion

High energy Inefficiency (In some networks)

High misinformation & tribalism or dependance on Web2 Social Media

Highly extractive economics

ImpactDAO Ratings DAO - ImpactDAOs are the atomic unit of the Regenerative CryptoEconomics movement.  The positive externalities produced by each ImpactDAO, when stacked upon each other, will hopefuly create an entire Regenerative CryptoEconomics stack.

&#x20;

But how are we to know which ImpactDAOs are truly having impact and which are just marketing?  “don’t trust, verify” is a mantra among cryptographers, how can we apply this to the growing field of ImpactDAOs?

&#x20;

Having an ImpactDAO Ratings DAO, which catalogued the positive and negative externalities of each ImpactDAO, would be an import piece of infrastructure (provided that it is governed in a transparent & credibly neutral way, to gain the legitimacy needed to be seen as impartial)

It would be possible to overemphasize to creation of an academically perfect system, and in doing so, forget about the cultural & memetic needs of a community. &#x20;

&#x20;

Starting with small pods of culture that are themselves healthy is a must.  As a founder, your actions inform the actions of the first 5 people in your project.  Those 5 inform the next 20, which informs the next 100, and so on.

&#x20;

Peter Pan, the founder of MetaCartel, one of the most prominent & first DAOs in web3, is a shining example of this.  He formed MetaCartel as a series of “pods” with their own individual culture, vibes, and mission.  Metacartel is not a single monolithic group.  Each pod had its own mission, goals, and focus and tightly curated culture.  They each started small + only grew when they were ready.  Once they grew, they retroactive gave away governance rights based upon the values they had set early.

Starting small with healthy culture

121

&#x20;

&#x20;

Here are a few meta-patterns you will find across different regenerative cryptoeconomic systems:

&#x20;

&#x20;\- pluralism: skin to biodiversity.  The more pluralism there is  across an ecosystem, this creates more antifragility as it grows.

\- expressivity: eg the collection of primitives available should be reach enough to allow actors to express organizations we've not thought of yet.

\- simplicity/legibility: individual primitives should be relatively simple, you can combine them into more complex assemblages.&#x20;

\- standardization: a sufficiently large library of legible primitives that you can almost always find a known simple/legible component that meets your needs, will accelerate innovation.

\- modularity/composibility: this comes pretty naturally from simplicity and standardization, and assuming you collection of primitives is sufficiently expressive you can create assemblages that do just about anything.

\- symmetry between value creation & value capture - when the value creation&#x20;

of a system is disconnected from the value capture, there will be an inherent misalignment between the incentives of actors in the system to focus on the capture of value instead of the creation of it.  Therefore regenerative cryptoeconomic systems aim for symmetry between value creation & value capture.

Meta-patterns

&#x20;

Robust Signal Emission

An alternative to governance via voting (which has historically had issues with plutocracy and low voter turnout) is robust signal emission.

&#x20;

The measurement of value creation via robust signal creation is a powerful way to allocate funds to an ecosystem of participants at scale.

&#x20;

By measuring what communities of participants within an ecosystem value, an intersubjective consensus of the value creation from that ecosystem is created.  This intersubjetive consensus can form the basis of a distribution of retroactive tokenized rewards.

Robust Signal Generation

User Engagement Feedback Loop

Of course, in order to create a robust set of signals, one needs to have an active ecosystem of participants.

&#x20;

To that end, there are a number of engagement hacking techniques that were pioneered in the web2 days, which also work in the web3 space.

&#x20;

While they are not regenerative in nature themselves, they can be assmebled into regenerative cryptoeconomic systems wherein their data emissions can be analyzed for regenerative purposes, and we include them on this basis.

Widely articulated by Pintrest, this articulation of a feedback loop of user engagement is designed to keep users engaged by triggering their interest to perform some action, for when they are given a reward + are prompted to make further investment of time or other resources.

What is an ImpactDAO?

A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization; some DAOs are like global companies.  Some are protocols. All of them use blockchains as a trust anchor.&#x20;

&#x20;

An ImpactDAO is any DAO that creates positive externalities for the ecosystem in which it resides.

&#x20;

ImpactDAOs are the scalable building block of a more regenerative economic infrastructure.

Positive Externality:

Funding for Public Goods

Examples of ImpactDAOs

One powerful attribute of clusters of ImpactDAOs is how the positive externalities flow between them.  For example, Sybil Resistance flows from Proof of Humanity into GitcoinDAO, which in turn has funded projects in the Proof of Humanity Ecosystem, including KlimaDAO.

Two Ingredients for an ImpactDAO:

Mechanism & Funding Source

Inflation

Optimism&#x20;

Sequencer Fees

The diversity in the mechanisms & funding sources for ImpactDAOs creates a pluralism (and anti-fragility) in the way public goods are funded.

&#x20;

&#x20;

The Big Idea

1\. Build a parallel opt-in system for funding digital native public goods, which operates at greater efficiency at a greater scale.

&#x20;

2\. This parallel opt-in system could increasingly support non digital public goods.

&#x20;

3\. As more people quit their private jobs to work on public good, energy in one public good seeps into another, a sense of 21st century native civic pride emerges, momentum compounds outwards in a virtuous cycle of growth.

&#x20;

4\. More global public goods get funded.  Over decades, economies & democracies all over the world get upgraded be higher bandwidth for the digital age, creating more human thriving.

&#x20;

ImpactDAOs can stack

Each ImpactDAO benefits from all the stacked ImpactDAOs supporting their work.

Scalability: ImpactDAO stacking is how growth compounds, momentum builds, and regenerative cryptoeconomics eventually becomes inevitable.

&#x20;

Pluralism: Because each ImpactDAO can have a different mechanism or funding source, this leads to a more pluralistic public goods funding infrastructure.

Each ImpactDAO benefits when public goods below them in the stack are funded.

All coordination is a choice.&#x20;

&#x20;

We have to choose the future we want in the day to day choices we make - not only in the types of assets we buy, but also in where we put our scarce time, attention, and skills.

IT’S ALL

COORDINATION

&#x20;

&#x20;

An inchoate virtous cycle

All coordination is a choice.  To win this coordination game, we need to choose to coordinate to make this into a multiplayer game.  Once the multiplayer game is bootstrapped, we need to choose coordinate to win it.  Once we win it, we must coordinate to maintain its legitimacy. &#x20;

&#x20;

We do these things not for their own sake, but as a means to create human thriving. If we collectively all take the green pill, we create a more solarpunk world.  If we collectively do not, we continue to maintain the status quo.  Regenerative CryptoEconomics is here, it’s important, and it’s happening.  But it is also inchoate.  To grow, it needs you.

The overton window is open.  Join the movement. Do what your skills & abilities uniquely enable you to do.  Spread the word.  Build something.  Learn from your mistakes, & throw it out & build something else.  Host a meetup.  Be honest about where we’re winning & also where we fall short.  Do what feels right to you. Do your own research. Beware any charistmatic leader who claims to have all the answers (including me).  The leader is the person who knows what to do next.

&#x20;

And whatever you do, remember to coordinate.
