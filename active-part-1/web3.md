# Web3

Web3 layers have

路        Data storage layer

路        Consensus layer

路        End-Use Layer

路        Data Traffic Layer

While PoW and PoS are by far the most prevalent in the blockchain space, there are other consensus algorithms like [Proof of Capacity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-capacity-cryptocurrency.asp) (PoC) which allow sharing of memory space of the contributing nodes on the blockchain network. The more memory or hard disk space a node has, the more rights it is granted for maintaining the public ledger. [Proof of Activity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-activity-cryptocurrency.asp) (PoA), used on the [Decred](https://www.investopedia.com/news/decred-cryptocurrency-combines-pow-pos/) blockchain, is a hybrid that makes use of aspects of both PoW and PoS. [Proof of Burn](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-burn-cryptocurrency.asp) (PoB) is another that requires transactors to send small amounts of cryptocurrency to inaccessible wallet addresses, in effect "burning" them out of existence.

Another, called Proof of History (PoH), developed by the Solana Project and similar to [Proof of Elapsed Time](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-elapsed-time-cryptocurrency.asp) (PoET), encodes the passage of time itself cryptographically to achieve consensus without expending many resources.
