[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) developers are working on the [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning\_Network) that would reduce energy demand of the network by moving most transactions off the blockchain.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental\_impact\_of\_cryptocurrencies#cite\_note-smart-energy.com-39)\[[_better source needed_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS)]

[Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) is planning a transition from proof of work to a proof of stake algorithm.
