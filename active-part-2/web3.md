# Web3

`Currently web3 is ran on web2, though web3 could be done through carrier pigeons, smoke signals, or wire fences.`&#x20;

The internet is now highly utilized globally for education, healthcare, business opportunities, etc. Phones are connecting to the internet, allowing global communication and TV has largely now shifted to being an app (Netflix for example) that one can access via their internet connection. There are five components to the web.&#x20;

![There are five components to the web; physical (A), data (B), applications (C), internet (D), and transport (E).](<../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)

## Physical

&#x20;Physical is the hardware that is needed for the internet; usually a laptop, TV and a phone. However, there is a hidden layer.&#x20;

## Data&#x20;

Whenever a person interacts with the physical component, moves a mouse, touches a keyboard, speaks into a phone, turns on their TV data is generated. This data is structured and stored within the physical. There will be an estimated 175 zettabytes of data needed to be stored by 2025 (1). Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook currently collectively store at least 1.2 zettabytes in their physical components (data storage systems) (2). This data is analyzed by each of these companies adding an additional layer to the physical components (computing systems). &#x20;

## Applications

One way in which people on the internet interact with data is in the form of applications. Well known application examples are the search engine of Google or Facebook's social media app.&#x20;

## Internet&#x20;

Once the data is generated, people want to communicate with other people about it. The sending of this data from person to person, is the foundation of the internet. There are different ways in which this data is structured to make it legible for the person on the other side, such as IP addresses.

## Transport&#x20;

Structuring is just one part of sending data, the other aspect is the actual infrastructure needed to do so. Fiber networks, cables able to send data to and from parts of the world at high speeds, span throughout our world. Satellite systems, such as [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/), are also able to transport this data. &#x20;

## Problems with Web2

### Physical

In North Korea the physical components that people are able to purchase easily are heavily modified so that North Korea can control what data their population has access to and easilly access the data that the population creates (3). This control of the physical layer is able to be replicated in other parts of the world and likely has.&#x20;

Lenovo, HP Inc and Dell have over 50% of the global PC market share (4). Microsoft has strategic alliances and partnerships with each of these companies, increasing the reach of Microsoft to at least 50% of PCs in terms of hardware. The operating systems installed on the physical layers of computers are around 90% of the time from Microsoft (5).&#x20;

### Data

If you have used the physical layer large tech companies of Google, Microsoft, Apple (phones and computers) or If you have interacted with applications like search engines (Google, Yahoo) or applications like Facebook it is likely that your data is stored in one of their data centers. Once the data is stored, these companies are able to monetize off your data. Potential revenue sources includes selling it to advertisers, governments, or other entities interested in using it. These companies themselves have made some of the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems in the world (such as Google Translate). People can access these AI's however they have not been paid for the use of their data.   &#x20;

If you have used the physical layer of Google, Microsoft (phones and computers) or if you interacted with the search engine (Yahoo) or application (Facebook) your data it is likely that your data is stored in one of these data centers (6).&#x20;
{% endembed %}

### Applications

Google and Meta (Facebook) alone have influence on greater than 70% of internet traffic, the remaining 30% is shared by all other apps and sites (7). If you search- lawsuits Google or lawsuits Facebook you can see just how many lawsuits these companies are in. The lawsuits range from privacy infringements, to theft of intellectual property, to discrimination, to genocide, to damaging youth's health, etc. Again, these companies control 70% of the internet, that's around 70% of the world's data transmissions...&#x20;

Applications have regularly occurring outages and or delays. Big tech giants like Microsoft, Reddit and Snapchat are also subject to these outages.&#x20;

![Application outages for the last 24 hours, retrieved on 6/19/22 (9).](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

### Internet

Between 2018 and 2020 there were anywhere from 155-213 government-induced internet shutdowns in 25-33 different countries (10). We hear stories of the great Chinese firewall, but the reality is all over the world individuals are being censored and having surveillance placed upon them by governments (11).&#x20;

![Censorship and surveillance by country 2018 (12)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

The level of internet censorship ranges from short term blackouts and disruptions, to persistent multi-month or multi- year blackouts and disruptions, to somewhat restrictive long-term controls with disruption surges, to highly restrictive long-term structural controls (13). On average an internet outage costs per person anywhere from USD $0.06-$2.36 per day (14). To give one example, in 2022 to today (6/19/22), Russia's internet outage has cost them USD $6,770,000,000 (15). &#x20;

![Internet Outages in last 24 hours taken on 6/19/22 (16).](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

One company, Level 3 (acquired by Lumen Technologies), handles sending data to and from (through IP addresses and ASes) just under 80% of the conventional internet (17). This company has been accused of wiretapping Google, Yahoo, and a German Internet Exchange Point on behalf of the National Security Administration of the US (17). Other major companies in this domain (IP addresses and ASes) manage a slight percentage in comparison to Level 3 (such as Cogent, Global Telecom and Technology, TeliaSonera International Carrier, NTT Communications, Tata Communications, Telecom Italia Sparkle). However, they have been caught up in similar legal ordeals. Such as TeliaSonera collaborating with certain dictatorships, allowing them to spy on their citizens, and in 2012 they were investigated for bribery and money laundering in Uzbekistan (17).

## Transport

A complex system of fiber cables, satellites, receivers and transmitters transports data globally. Rodents often represent a more practical threat to these systems than cyber attackers (18, 19). Though signal jamming can still take place by entities, including governments. There are many different businesses involved in transport.&#x20;

## Centralization of the Web

4 companies are able to access and utilize anywhere from 70-90% of data on the internet. This creates a dangerous level of centralization. These companies are able to influence governments to individuals in the way they access, interact with and transmit data. Governments can block the data being transmitted and cater it to their liking for the population, which is already done globally. Allowing corporations and governments to control the flow of data allows select individuals to have disproportionate power as compared to the rest of the population. If the top apps were to pay you for the data you generate when using them (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, etc.), you'd get around $2,000 a year (20). At the same time it would take the average Facebook user alone being paid over $1,000 a year to stop using Facebook (21).&#x20;

![Known examples of centralization of web2 (5, 7, 17). ](<../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png>)

## Web3

Web 3.0 entails that internet access will be universal and ubiquitous, across regions, networks, and devices. completely open-source architecture that anyone can use, modify, monetise, and extend without any restrictions.

Open-source architecture will also encourage greater accountability, as peer reviews will be more common

Web3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.

open, transparent, decentralized, peer-to-peer.

### User and Creator Incentivisation

Web 3.0 will aim for a better balance in creator economics. Right now, there are few checks and balances on how online creators are compensated for their work – and a small percentage often receives a disproportionate share of incentives.

**Trustless and permissionless**

Meanwhile, the concept of user incentivisation does not exist at all. For example, users may be rewarded with tokens or cryptocurrency for willingly sharing their data to keep things transparent.

This kind of clear incentivisation will be a big part of the Web 3.0 experience in order to drive accountability among every stakeholder.

### Decentralisation and Interoperability

### Login

Crypto wallet

### Physical

To take the first step into web3, take your computer, mobile phone or other electronic device and replace it's operating system with a privacy preserving open source one (such as Linux or Tails). This operating system will allow you to keep personal control of your data, unlike Microsoft, Apple and other operating systems. In terms of what the device is, it doesn't really matter. Electronic devices will continue to be produced no matter the web version we are on or operating system we use.&#x20;

All electronic devices (cellphones, smartwatches, sensors, computers, headphones, etc.) are able to be a part of web3. Most people don't want to run a lot of electronic devices that have a lot of storage space and computing power, some do. Event then, it's unlikely that you are always using all of the computing power and storage space that your electronic devices have. At times when this computing power and storage space is not in use by you, it should still be able to benefit you. Decentralized storage  (Filecoin, Storj, IPFS, Arweave, etc.) and computing power systems (Golem, iExec, Sonm) allow you to sell excess storage and computing power when not in use. At the same time it allows you to purchase storage and computing power when needs demand, all while maintaining anonymity. The potential for this means that you could pay to trigger an analysis that needs the computing capacity of several super computers from your smartwatch or someone can pay to upload their data, retain sole control of it and have versions of it spread across hundreds of computers.&#x20;

Electronic devices that are part of web3 will be able to receive and transmit in an ever increasing number of wavelengths (such as bluetooth, wifi, radio and other relay techniques) as well as translate them into other forms (such as translating radio into wifi).&#x20;

### Data

Interacting with the web is where it gets tricky in terms of data. Even the most advanced web browsers (TOR, Brave Browser, etc.) are profiting from the data of their users (22, 23). Codes on most websites track information on the people that visit them (such as Javascript). Though this code is not directly owned by any one organization. It's used by several, such as Google Analytics, as something that can be put into the website to track more info on the people that are visiting it. Google Analytics is used on 55.7% of all websites and caters data not only for those websites but for Google as a company (that's not to mention tracking done by Google Scripts) (24). TOR, Brave and other browsers don't pay their user base for the data collected of them by Javascript, instead they fund their organizations with this money (TOR has the ability for users to opt out). Luckily TOR, Brave and other browsers are open source and can be forked. Integrating the ability in this forked version of a browser can allow users to have ownership of this data and monetize off it using data marketplaces (Ocean Protocol, dClimate, etc.).&#x20;

### Applications

Applications for video sharing (Youtube, Tik Tok), social media (Facebook, Instagram), messaging and video calls (Zoom, Skype), Music (Spotify, Pandora) are already becoming decentralized. If you look up decentralized applications in front of each of the types of applications you are interested in, it will show a list of dapps already available. Levels of decentralization of these apps are questionable, one of the major NFT marketplaces for example (Opensea) was able to stop transactions from occurring rising questions over the level of centralized authority that OpenSea has (25).  &#x20;

### Internet&#x20;

In web2 interacting on the internet is routed through domain names, DNS, and IP addresses. In web3 these interactions are routed through decentralized naming conventions (like ethereum name service, ENS) that are tied to a contract address (mix of letters and numbers that looks like 0x2D237B830B6dC666439b963B2C0871E3e7f6C020). &#x20;

### Transport

Fiber transport layers are fragile as they break by getting gnawed by rodents, have a limited life span, and only distribute to areas attached to their cables. Satellites are likely to become an increasing transport layer. Satellite systems for transporting blockchains (such as Bitcoin) are already appearing (such as Blockstream Satellites). However, entities (such as governments) are able to block electromagnetic wavelengths (such as radio) from these satellites for receivers. The most powerful blockers known can only block a wavelength in a buffer of up to 125 miles (26). If receivers outside of this buffer are still able to receive it, the signal could be relayed through small range network connections, such as mesh networks. These networks connect to electronic devices to communicate with each other through the electromagnetic spectrum (bluetooth, wifi, radio and other relay techniques) (Helium, FOAM, TxTenna). Any electronic device, could be relayers in a mesh network. These same devices could also potentially serve as translators for altering the communication into another wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum (such as translating radio to wifi). When an entity blocks the signal from a receiver the mesh network can send a message to transfer to another wavelength (for both transmission and reception). As there are almost an unlimited amount of wavelengths, using coordination, it would be very difficult to block.&#x20;

`Product idea: Login to the device through crypto wallet, create a virtual machine run Linux/ Tails on it, Fork TOR so no data is sold through organization and people have the choice to sell their data to benefit them, allow people to opt in their devices for decentralized storage and computing power systems, if they opt in for decentralized storage allowing that storage to be accessible to data markets, allow that computer to become a multi wavelength transceiver and translator.`&#x20;

&#x20;Alchemy, Moralis- to communicate with blockchains, you need to run a node. Essentially, nodes are pieces of software that connect with other nodes on the same chain. As such, nodes enable you to speak with the chain (the blockchain network) and access its data. The problem is that running a node is a full-time job. In most cases, it requires a team for maintenance, proper backup, and much more. Thus, it is not a proper solution for developers. That is why there are several specialized [blockchain node providers](https://moralis.io/infura-alternatives-and-blockchain-node-providers/?utm\_source=blog\&utm\_medium=post\&utm\_campaign=Exploring%2520the%2520Web3%2520Tech%2520Stack%2520%25E2%2580%2593%2520Full%2520Guide) that devote all their time to running nodes.

State changes on this state machine are governed by the rules of consensus that the peers in the network follow.

One more thing to know: data can only be written to the Ethereum blockchain — you can never update existing data.

A smart contract is a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain and defines the logic behind the state changes happening on the blockchain. Smart contracts are written in high-level languages, such as Solidity or Vyper.

smart contract code is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, anyone can inspect the application logic of all smart contracts on the network

Up next, you have the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which executes the logic defined in the smart contracts and processes the state changes that happen on this globally accessible state machine.

The EVM doesn’t understand high-level languages like Solidity and Vyper, which are used to write smart contracts. Instead, you have to compile the high-level language down into bytecode, which the EVM can then execute.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)

Once you connect to the blockchain through a provider (metamask), you can read the state stored on the blockchain. But if you want to write to the state, there’s still one more thing you need to do before you can submit the transaction to the blockchain— “sign” the transaction using your private key.

nodes can give you the raw data from the blockchain. However, unfortunately, that raw data is rather useless.

**Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning**: In Web 3.0, computers will be able to understand information similarly to humans, through technologies based upon Semantic Web concepts and natural language processing. Web 3.0 will also use [machine learning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/machine-learning.asp), which is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses data and algorithms to imitate how humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. These capabilities will enable computers to produce faster and more relevant results in a host of areas like drug development and new materials, as opposed to merely targeted advertising that forms the bulk of current efforts.

#### Metaverse

Whenever we talk about the future, the [metaverse](https://www.plainconcepts.com/metaverse-companies/) is one of the first words that come to mind. Well, this new version of the Internet could be perfectly integrated with this virtual universe, allowing 3D designs of websites, as well as adding IoT devices in its periphery.

[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8717702](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8717702)

The original Internet service architecture was to build a common decentralized network with equal participation, that communicated using peer to peer interconnectivity without relying on a single computer \[1]. Another important consideration of the original Internet’s plan was that computers must be interoperable among dissimilar systems, so that more devices could be a part of the network.

If one possesses a computational power which is higher than 50% of the computational power of the whole network, one can try to delete a transaction from the blockchain by sending a modified blockchain as consensus. Bitcoin's hash power sums up to more than 10,000,000 TH/s at the end of October 2017 \[29], which means that about 740,741 units of one of the strongest miner (Antminer S9, 13.5 TH/s, 1265 dollars apiece as of 4th October, 2017, see \[30] and \[31]) are needed. This would cost around 937 million dollars not including electricity costs and other needed efforts.

able to show that online trust increases when personally identifiable information is disclosed

if a technology does not allow the identification of individuals, the likelihood of inappropriate actions increases and therefore, the technology will be considered as less trustworthy

When users perceive that they remain anonymous in their use of technology, it seems that users tend to rely on technological measures, such as the immutability of information, to build trust. In contrast, if users perceive that they are identifiable when using technology, the immutability of information seems to be less relevant. Thus, during the use of technology, users seem to be subject to a kind of social control, which is also in line with the accountability theory.

Trust refers to the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other party will perform an action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party (Mayer et al. [1995](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-019-00392-5#ref-CR30)). Trust is a dynamic concept that develops over time (Luna-Reyes et al. [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-019-00392-5#ref-CR29)). It is an individual’s reliance on another person under conditions of dependence and risk (Kramer and Tyler [1996](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-019-00392-5#ref-CR22)). Reliance allows another person to take control of one’s assets. A trustor is someone who holds certain expectations about the other party, while the trustee is a person or an entity that is assessed by the trustor (Becerra and Gupta [2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-019-00392-5#ref-CR2)).

Recall that one property of a cryptographic hash function is the inability to deduce any of the input by looking at the output. Hence, we have no idea what values of _W_ will yield a hash with the desired properties. Servers have to try trillions of values with the hope that they will get lucky and find a value that yields the desired hash. This process of searching for _W_ is called **mining**.

When a server finds a value of _W_ that yields the desired hash, it advertises that value to the entire set of bitcoin servers. Upon receiving this message, it is trivial for a server to validate the proof of work by simply computing _hash(B, A, W)_ with the _W_ sent in the message and checking the resultant value. The servers then add the block, which contains the Proof of Work number and the winner’s address, onto the blockchain.

used by Bitcoin and Ethereum servers to migrate copies of the transaction log- set of hashes

Bitcoin uses public-private key pairs and digital signatures to sign transactions

Transactions are sent to all the participating servers. Each system keeps a **complete copy** of the entire ledger, which records all transactions from the very first one. Currently the bitcoin ledger is about [400 GB](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/blocks-size).

Transactions are grouped into a **block**. A block is just a partial list of transactions. When a server is ready to do so, it can add the block to the ledger, forming a linked list of blocks that comprise the **blockchain**. In Bitcoin, a block contains ten minutes worth of transactions, all of which are considered to be concurrent.

Every ten minutes, a new block of transactions is added to the blockchain. A block is approximately a megabyte in size and holds, on average, a bit over 2,000 transactions. To make it easy to locate a specific transaction within a block, the blocks are stored in a **Merkle tree**. This is a binary tree of hash pointers and makes it easy not just to locate a desired transaction but to validate that it has not been tampered by validating the chain of hashes along the path.

When servers are ready to commit a block of transactions onto the chain, they each compute this hash, trying various values of _W_ until the hash result has a specific pre-defined property. The property they are searching for is a hash value that is less than some given number. Currently, it’s a value that requires the leading 74 bits of the 256-bit hash to all be 0s). The property changes over time to ensure that the puzzle never gets too easy or too difficult regardless of how many nodes are in the network or how fast processors get.

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is adjusted every 2,016 blocks, which corresponds to approximately 14 days, to keep the average rate at which blocks are added to the blockchain at 10 minutes. This allows the network to handle changes in the number of miners participating in computing the proof work.

Because of the chain structure, it requires more work to modify older transactions (more blocks = more proof of work computations). Modifying only the most recent block is not hugely challenging. Hence, the further back a transaction is in the blockchain, the less likely it is that anyone can amass the computing power to change it and create a competing blockchain.

A transaction is considered **confirmed** after some number, _N_, additional blocks are added to the chain. The value of _N_ is up to the party receiving the transaction - a level of comfort. The higher the number, the deeper the transaction is in the blockchain and the harder it is to alter. Bitcoin recommends _N_=1 for low-value transactions (payments under $1,000; this enables them to be confirmed quickly), _N_=3 for deposits and mid-value transactions, and _N_=6 for large payments (e.g., $10k…$1M). Even larger values of _N_ could be used for extremely large payments.

To avoid rewarding false blockchains as well as to encourage continued mining efforts, the miner is rewarded only after 99 additional blocks have been added to the ledger.

* Merkle trees are made by hashing pairs of nodes repeatedly until only one hash remains; this hash is known as the Merkle Root or the Root Hash.
* They're built from the bottom, using Transaction IDs, which are hashes of individual transactions.&#x20;
* Each non-leaf node is a hash of its previous hash, and every leaf node is a hash of transactional data.

  * If Bitcoin didn't include Merkle Trees, per se, every node on the network would have to retain a complete copy of every single Bitcoin transaction ever made. One can imagine how much information that would be.

a blockchain is formed by “blocks” connected via hash pointers

Merkle tree is a per-block tree of all the transactions that are included in the block

A Merkle proof is used to decide:

1. If data belongs to a particular Merkle tree.
2. To prove data belongs to a set without the need to store the whole set.
3. To prove a certain data is included in a larger data set without revealing the larger data set or its subsets.

to verify the presence of ‘a’, ‘a’ does not have to be revealed nor do ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ have to be revealed, only their hashes are sufficient

the Merkle root in the header with the Merkle root stored in the data part of a block and can easily detect this tampering

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) refers to the technological infrastructure and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an immutable manner across a network that's spread across multiple entities or locations.



coinbase- distribution of new coins

backchecks the hash to come up with an answer, If the first 20 bits are not all zero, the hash is invalid

A Bitcoin miner runs a computer program that collects unconfirmed transactions from users on the network. Together, these can form a "block" and earn a payment to the miner, but a block is only accepted by the network if its hash meets the network's difficulty target. Thus, as in hashcash, miners must discover by brute force the ["nonce"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic\_nonce) that, when included in the block, results in an acceptable hash.

Unlike hashcash, Bitcoin's difficulty target does _not_ specify a minimum number of leading zeros in the hash. Instead, the hash is interpreted as a (very large) integer, and this integer must be less than the target integer. This is necessary because the Bitcoin network must periodically adjust its difficulty level to maintain an average time of 10 minutes between successive blocks. If only leading zeros were considered, then the difficulty could only be doubled or halved, causing the adjustment to greatly overshoot or undershoot in response to small changes in the average block time. Still, the number of leading zeros in the target serves as a good approximation of the current difficulty. In January 2020, [block #614525](https://blockstream.info/614525) had 74 leading zeros.

one block can therefore cover around 4000 transactions with an average size of 250 bytes.

although there are some blocks with only one transaction, meaning that the miner included no transactions except for their own reward transaction

After validation, the transaction must be included into a block. To do this, the miner (the node) picks transactions from the mem-pool, recursively hashing pairs of transaction hash values until there is only one remaining; this is called the Merkle root \[RM80]. The cryptographic hash algorithm used in Bitcoin’s Merkle trees is SHA256, applied twice, also known as double-SHA256.&#x20;

Mimpool is the pool of transactions

Firstly, they earn new coins, which are created with each new block in the so called coinbase transaction automatically. That grants the mining reward to the miner. Secondly, they receive transaction fees

PoW= Fd(c|x) ® SHA256(SHA256(h|x) ≦ 2 224/d The Bitcoin Universe 13 where h can be seen as a challenge, x the nonce and d the actual difficulty \[RW16]. If Fd(h|x) is not smaller than the current target, the miner will modify the nonce (usually just incrementing it by one) and calculate the block hash again. At the current level of difficulty in the Bitcoin network, miners have to try quadrillions of times before finding a nonce that results in a low enough block header hash. The length of time it takes to mine a block can be controlled with the difficulty,16 d. In order to keep the block generation time to 10 minutes on average regardless of the technology (increasing compute power of miners) used, the difficulty of mining must be adjusted. In fact, difficulty is a dynamic parameter that is periodically (every 2016 blocks or every 14 days) adjusted to meet a 10-minute block target. Adjustment of the difficulty occurs automatically and independently on every full node after every 2016 blocks, and all nodes retarget the proof of work difficulty. The equation for retargeting difficulty compares the time to find the last 2,016 blocksto 20,160 minutes, i.e., the time needed based on the 10-minute average block generation time. This can be put in simple terms as follows: if the network is finding blocks faster than every 10 minutes, the difficulty increases; if block creation time is slower than expected, the difficulty decreases. The last step in Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism is the independent validation of each new block by every node in the network. As the newly solved block is propagated across the network, each node performs a series of tests to validate it before propagating it to its peers. This ensures that only valid blocks are propagated on the network. This independent validation also ensures that miners who act honestly have their blocks incorporated in the blockchain, thus earning the reward.

Converting hash to numbers

To solve the hash puzzle, miners will try to calculate the hash of a block by adding a nonce to the block header repeatedly until the hash value yielded is less than the target.

Difficulty of matching hash is changed so that blocks are created only every 10 minutes the current amount of hashes probably needed to be done to find a valid nonce is 30 trillion. If a new nonce was tried every second, it would take 30 trillion seconds or 900,000 years (three times longer than the existence of humans on this earth [https://theconversation.com/when-did-we-become-fully-human-what-fossils-and-dna-tell-us-about-the-evolution-of-modern-intelligence-143717#:\~:text=Fossils%20and%20DNA%20suggest%20people,evolved%20around%20300%2C000%20years%20ago.](https://theconversation.com/when-did-we-become-fully-human-what-fossils-and-dna-tell-us-about-the-evolution-of-modern-intelligence-143717))

Inability to counterfeit

with the proof of stake, the creator of a new block is chosen in a deterministic way, depending on its wealth, also defined as stake. This means that in the PoS system there is no block reward, so, the miners take the transaction fees.

If a node with the selected wallet is running, it will collect the transactions, make a block, and send it to the rest of the network and collect the fees.

Proof of Stake varies in that there is no nonce that can be iterated over, rather the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) in the nodes local wallet are iterated over. The main variable then becomes time, the time of each hash attempt is part of the hashing, and thus allows 1 hash, per UTXO, per second. So a wallet with 100 UTXOs can only create 100 unique hashes per second (the node could create more hashes but that would be pointless as they would just repeat). Some coins mask the bottom bits of the epoch time, to limit the amount of hashing further, often to hashes every 8 or 16 seconds. To prevent users creating many tiny UTXOs there is a lower limit of coins that are viable for staking in a UTXO (often around 0.01 coins) and the difficulty is modified by the number of coins in a UTXO; a UTXO with 2 coins has a hash target that is twice as easy as a UTXO with 1 coin. In this way then we can see that every coin staking has a roughly equal chance of creating a block, and a user with a large number of coins will be likely to make more blocks and earn more transaction fees than a user with less coins.

There are variants of PoS, but they all basically work in this same way, and by doing so prevent the need for massive quantities of computing power to spew out zillions of nonces and hashes to secure a block-chain.

Proof of Stake is safe because those who stake on the network to validate the transactions risk their entire stake. If they’re involved in malicious transactions, not only would they ruin the reputation of the project in which they are already heavily involved, but they would lose everything they held within that stake as well.

Furthermore, staking your coins requires freezing them––in other words, agreeing not to sell them––and taking a long-term investment in a project. Given that rapid price shifts can be affected by large investors (or whales), staking coins provides a different type of safety as well. At least in theory, Proof of Stake models can help prevent rapid sales and tanking of projects.

Since PoS does not use high amounts of electricity, the block reward can be lowered, removed, or even have a negative block issuance (burning the fees). By creating a negative block reward (burning), the price of the currency should in theory, increase. Additionally, this way, the price could be controlled better and could cause less volatility.

Rich validators will get richer as they will be picked more often. This risks a higher wealth concentration in the long run, hence the centralization of wealth in only a few nodes.



Eth and ETC when hack occured- hard forked and reverted the blocks that had that transaction to say it wasn't valid

One of the most successful ICOs was The DAO, a decentralized venture fund where investors would vote on assets to invest in. The DAO quickly accumulated more than 11 million ETH, from over 18,000 investors, before unknown hackers discovered a smart contract bug allowing them to withdraw about a third of The DAO's accumulated ether

First, they would install more mining capacity than the rest of the network put together, creating a so-called '51% attack'. Second, instead of openly participating in the mining process, they would mine their own 'secret branch', containing whichever transactions they approve and censoring the rest. Finally, when the desired amount of time had passed, they would anonymously broadcast their secret branch to the network.

Let's estimate the cost of a 51% attack which reverses a year of bitcoin transactions. At the current bitcoin price of $1,500 and reward of 15 bitcoins (including transaction fees) per 10-minute block, miners earn around $1.2bn per year ($1500 × 15 × 6 × 24 × 365). Assuming (reasonably) that they are not losing money overall, or at least not losing much, this means that total miner expenses must also be in the same range.
