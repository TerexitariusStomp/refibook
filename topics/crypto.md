Principles of Web3

immutable - so that if the founder of a web3 protocol turns evil, then the  protocol itself cannot change.

transparent - all code & state is viewable by everyone equally.

decentralized - cannot be captured by anyone.

programmable - so it can be used to create coordination via novel mechanism design.

global - equally accessible from anywhere in the world.
